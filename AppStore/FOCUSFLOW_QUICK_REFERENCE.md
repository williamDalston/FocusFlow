## REVIEW NOTES FOR APPLE
```
This app provides a Pomodoro timer for focus and productivity. The app helps users break work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. All data is stored locally on the device. No account creation or login required. The app includes timer presets, session tracking, statistics, Apple Watch support, and iOS Widgets. The app uses AdMob for advertising (interstitial ads shown after focus sessions). All focus data is stored locally and never shared.
