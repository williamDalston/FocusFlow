2. **Health Data:** HealthKit is not used in this version of FocusFlow.

3. **Local Storage:** Data stored locally on the device (UserDefaults) typically doesn't need to be declared unless you sync it to a server.

4. **Tracking:** The app uses App Tracking Transparency (ATT) for tracking. Users can opt out.

5. **User Control:** Users can:
   - Opt out of ad tracking in iOS Settings
   - Delete all app data from within the app
